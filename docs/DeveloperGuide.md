### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1 r/volunteer`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `LogListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Log` objects that reside in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1 r/volunteer")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1 r/volunteer` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/src/main/java/scrolls/elder/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores all in-memory application data (i.e., `Datastore` and `UserPref` objects)
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores a `Datastore` object that represents the functional data in an application. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyDatastore` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

#### Datastore

<img src="images/DatastoreClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

Contains the `PersonStore`:

* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

Contains the `LogStore`:

* stores the currently 'selected' `Log` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Log>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/master/src/main/java/scrolls/elder/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both application data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `DatastoreStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `scrolls.elder.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find feature

#### Implementation

**`FindCommandParser` Class:** <br>
The `FindCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing user input and creating a corresponding `FindCommand` object for execution. The implementation involves several key steps:
* **Role Parsing**: The parser first identifies the roles specified in the user input, such as "volunteer" or "befriendee", using predefined flags (`SEARCH_VOLUNTEER_FLAG` and `SEARCH_BEFRIENDEE_FLAG`).
It determines whether the search should be restricted to a specific role, both roles, or neither.
* **Pair Flag Parsing**: Next, the parser extracts any flags indicating whether the search should include paired or unpaired individuals.
It determines whether the search should include paired individuals, unpaired individuals, both, or neither.
* **Tag Parsing**: The parser then parses any tags specified in the user input, which are prefixed with a tag indicator (`t/`). Tags are extracted and used to create a `TagListContainsTagsPredicate` object for filtering.
* **Name Parsing**: After extracting roles, pair flags, and tags, the parser processes the remaining input as potential name keywords for filtering.
* **Search Criteria Combination**: The parser combines the parsed search criteria (roles, pair flags, tags, and name keywords) into a single `FindCommand` object.
* **Handling Search Exceptions**: The parser checks for any invalid command formats or missing input parameters and throws a `ParseException` if necessary.
* **Return `FindCommand` Object**: Finally, the parser returns the constructed `FindCommand` object, encapsulating the parsed search criteria, for further execution.

**`FindCommand` Class:** <br>
The find command finds all persons whose names contain any of the given keywords, supports searches in separate Volunteer and Befriendee lists, search by tags, and by pairing status. The `FindCommand` class is responsible for executing the find operation based on parsed user input.

* **Command Execution:** The `execute()` method overrides the parent class Command method to perform the actual find operation.
It retrieves the PersonStore from the model to access the list of persons.
* **Search Criteria:** The class contains boolean flags (`isSearchingVolunteer`, `isSearchingBefriendee`) to determine whether to search volunteers, befriendees, or both.
Similar flags (`isSearchingPaired`, `isSearchingUnpaired`) are used to filter persons based on their pairing status.
* **Search Methods:*** `searchAllPersons()`, `searchVolunteerOnly()`, and `searchBefriendeeOnly()` methods are used to perform searches based on the specified criteria.
These methods update the filtered person list in the PersonStore based on the search predicates.
* **Result Handling:** The search results are wrapped in a `CommandResult` object, which contains a message indicating the number of persons found.
The message is formatted using the Messages class constants.

The following sequence diagram shows how a Find operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![FindSequenceDiagram1](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="images/FindSequenceDiagram2.png" alt="FindSequenceDiagram2" width="600">
</div>



#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Tag Parsing in FindCommandParser:** <br>

* **Alternative 1: (Current Choice):** Parsing tags separately from other search criteria.
  * Pros: Allows users to specify additional search criteria based on tags.
  * Cons: Requires additional parsing logic and potentially increases complexity in handling multiple search parameters.

* **Alternative 2:** Incorporating tags into the main search query without separate parsing.
  * Pros: Simplifies parsing logic by integrating tags directly into the search query.
  * Cons: May limit flexibility in specifying tag-based search criteria or require more sophisticated parsing algorithms.

**Aspect: Handling Search Criteria in FindCommand:** <br>

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Implementing separate predicates for name and tag search criteria.
  * Pros: Offers flexibility in defining and combining different search parameters.
  * Cons: May lead to redundant filtering or increased complexity in managing multiple predicates.

* **Alternative 2**: Consolidating search criteria into a single unified predicate.
  * Pros: Simplifies filtering logic by reducing the number of separate predicates.
    * Cons: May limit the flexibility to apply different search parameters independently or require more complex predicate structures.



### Pair/Unpair feature

#### Implementation

**`PairCommand` & `UnpairCommand` Class:** <br>

The `PairCommand` class is responsible for pairing two persons, and the `UnpairCommand` class is responsible for unpairing two persons. The `PairCommand` and `UnpairCommand` classes are executed by the `Logic` component.

The pair and unpair commands are facilitated by updating the `pairedWithName` and `pairedWithId` fields of the `Person` object. Two paired `Person`s will have their `pairedWithName` and `pairedWithId` fields updated to reflect the `name` and `personId` of the `Person` they are paired with, or removed when they are unpaired

The `name` is saved to facilitate easy identification of the paired `Person` when displaying the `Person` object. The `personId` is saved to facilitate easy retrieval of the paired `Person` object when needed.

The following sequence diagram shows how a pair operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![PairSequenceDiagram](images/PairSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="images/PairSequenceDiagram2.png" alt="PairSequenceDiagram2" width="600">
</div>

For the unpair operation, the sequence diagram is similar to the pair operation, with the `UnpairCommand` class executing the unpair operation.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: What attribute(s) should be saved in the `Person` object:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save the `name` and `personId` of the paired `Person`.
    * Pros: Might need extra steps to search for the paired `Person` as only the `name` and `personId` are saved.
    * Cons: Uses less memory.

* **Alternative 2:** Save the paired `Person` within the `Person` object.
  itself.
    * Pros: Easy to access and manipulate the paired `Person`.
    * Cons: Uses more memory and includes redundant information.

### Add Log feature

#### Implementation

The Add Log feature allows users to add a new log entry to the application.

The `LogAddCommand` class is responsible for creating a new log entry, and the `LogAddCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the user input to create a `LogAddCommand` object.

The following sequence diagram shows how a LogAdd operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![LogAddSequenceDiagram](images/LogAddSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="images/LogAddSequenceDiagram2.png" alt="LogAddSequenceDiagram2" width="600">
</div>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Whether to use unique `logId` for each `Log` object:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `logId` is automatically generated for each `Log` object, ensuring that each log entry has a unique identifier.
    * Pros: Ensures that each log entry is uniquely identified.
    * Cons: Adds complexity to the implementation of the `LogStore` (e.g., maintaining a `logIdSequence` to generate unique `logId` values)

* **Alternative 2:** The `logId` is not used, and the `Log` object is identified by its position in the list of logs.
    * Pros: Simplifies the process of adding a log entry.
    * Cons: May lead to confusion if log entries are deleted or reordered.

Here's an example of how you can use the Add Log feature:

1. To add a log entry, use the `addlog` command followed by the `volunteerId`, `befriendeeId`, `startdate`, `duration` and `remarks`. For example, `addlog v/1 b/2 s/2022-03-01-10:00 d/2 r/Visited Mr. Tan`.

2. The application will create a new log entry with the provided details and add it to the list of logs.

3. If the command is successful, the application will display a message indicating that the log entry has been added.

Please note that the `volunteerId` and `befriendeeId` must correspond to existing volunteers and befriendees in the application. The `startdate` should be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` and the `duration` should be the number of hours the visit lasted. The `remarks` field is optional and can be used to add any additional notes about the visit.

### Edit log feature

#### Implementation

The edit log feature allows user to modify the details of an existing log entry in the address book. The index of the log entry has to be edited is specified by the user in order to execute the `LogEditCommand`.

The `LogEditCommand` class is responsible for editing the details of a log entry,
and the `LogEditCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the user input to create a `LogEditCommand` object.

The following sequence diagram shows how a LogEdit operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![LogEditSequenceDiagram](images/LogEditSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="images/LogEditSequenceDiagram2.png" alt="LogEditSequenceDiagram2" width="600">
</div>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: What attribute(s) can be edited in the `Log` object:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `volunteerId`, `befriendeeId`, `startdate`, `duration` and `remarks` of the
    `Log` can be edited.
    * Pros: Provides flexibility for users to update various attributes of a log entry.
    * Cons: Accidental edits when editing contact ids in `Log` may lead to cascading effects in other
      attributes displayed, such as timeServed in volunteer contacts.
* **Alternative 2:** The `startdate`, `duration` and `remarks` of the `Log` can be edited, 
    while the `volunteerId`, `befriendeeId` is kept immutable.
    * Pros: Prevents cascading modifications of attributes displayed in `Person` contact.
    * Cons: Restricts the flexibility of the `LogEdit` feature

### Delete Log feature

#### Implementation

The Delete Log feature allows users to delete an existing log entry in the application.

The `LogDeleteCommand` class is responsible for deleting an existing log entry, and the `LogDeleteCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the user input to create a `LogDeleteCommand` object.

The following sequence diagram shows how a LogDelete operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![LogDeleteSequenceDiagram](images/LogDeleteSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="images/LogDeleteSequenceDiagram2.png" alt="LogDeleteSequenceDiagram2" width="600">
</div>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to update the `latestLogId` attribute of Persons when log is deleted:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A helper function that finds the `latestLogId` attribute of the `Person` objects when a log is deleted, in order to update the latest log if necessary.
    * Pros: Ensures that `latestLogId`is accurately updated and displayed when logs are deleted.
    * Cons: Two new `Person` objects are created whenever a log is deleted

* **Alternative 2:** Leave the updating of the latest log to the `Model` component
    * Pros: Simplifies the process of deleting a log entry.
    * Cons: Another component of the application must be responsible for updating the `latestLogId` attribute of the `Person` objects.


### Find Log feature

#### Implementation

The Find Log feature allows users to find a particular log entry that is displayed in the log list in the application.

The `LogFindCommand` class is responsible for finding an existing log entry, and the `LogFindCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the user input to create a `LogFindCommand` object.

The following sequence diagram shows how a LogFind operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![LogFindSequenceDiagram](images/LogFindSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="images/LogFindSequenceDiagram2.png" alt="LogFindSequenceDiagram2" width="600">
</div>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to specify what logs to find:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Logs of a specified person are displayed in the log list.
    * Pros: Allows for the display of a particular person's logs
    * Cons: Cannot search for a particular log

* **Alternative 2:** Search via the attributes of a log entry.
    * Pros: Allows for searching of logs with a particular attribute
    * Cons: Does not allow for the display of a particular person's logs


### Undo/Redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `DatastoreVersionStorage`. It is a data structure storing the undo/redo history of the datastores stored in the model, stored internally as an `datastoreVersions` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `DatastoreVersionStorage#commitDatastore()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current datastore state in its history.
* `DatastoreVersionStorage#executeUndo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns the previous address book state from its history, for the model to reset the datastore
* `DatastoreVersionStorage#executeRedo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns a previously undone address book state from its history, for the model to reset the datastore

`DatastoreVersionStorage#commitDatastore()` is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitDatastore()` while `Model#undoChanges()` and `Model#redoChanges()` call `DatastoreVersionStorage#executeUndo()` and `DatastoreVersionStorage#executeRedo()` respectively to carry out the undo and redo actions.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `DatastoreVersionStorage` will be initialized with the initial datastore state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single datastore state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5 r/volunteer` command to delete the 5th volunteer in the datastore. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitDatastore()`, causing the modified state of the datastore after the `delete 5 r/volunteer` command executes to be saved in the `datastoreVersions`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted datastore state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitDatastore()`, causing another modified datastore state to be saved into the `datastoreVersions`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitDatastore()`, so the datastore state will not be saved into the `datastoreVersions`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoChanges()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous datastore state, and restores the datastore to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Datastore state, then there are no previous Datastore states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoDatastore()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoChanges()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the datastore to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `datastoreVersions.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest datastore state, then there are no undone Datastore states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoDatastore()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the datastore, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitDatastore()`, `Model#undoChanges()` or `Model#redoChanges()`. Thus, the `datastoreVersions` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitDatastore()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `datastoreVersions`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix C: Effort**
TODO

## **Appendix D: Planned Enhancements**

Our current version of Elder Scrolls enables users to efficiently manage volunteers, befriendees, and their interactions. However, we have identified planned enhancements that will further improve the user experience and functionality of the application. 

* Team size: 5.

1. **Even more flexible Log Entry Editing**: The current `logedit` function does not allow users to reassign the volunteer or befriendee involved in a log, with the only way being to delete and re-add a new log. This could be inconvenient if someone accidentally inputs the wrong pair of indices resulting in a wrong pair being referenced. Hence, we plan to make `logedit` support reassignment of logs to other, valid pairs.
